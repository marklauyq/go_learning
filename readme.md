# Simple Scraper

This is a simple scrapper that will simply extract bodies from my favorite web
novel sites and store it in a DB

I will than create an API that will easily allow me to pull the bodies and out
and view it.

## Things to accomplish

* [ ] Make a request to pull data from the website
* [ ] Able to read the HTML data
* [ ] Try to get the next chapter
* [ ] Store what is the latest chapter that we have pulled
* [ ] Set up a server to grab the data
* [ ] View my current read chapters
* [ ] Write a script to check daily the latest chapters
